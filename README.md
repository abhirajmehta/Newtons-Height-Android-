## How it works ?
* The app uses a simple physics logic based on Newton's Second Law of Motion(Wonder why the app is named "Newton's Height" ?).
* To put it shortly, if an object is falling under no force i.e if an is object freely falling, the distance that it covers before touching the ground can be calculated using the time that it takes to reach the ground.
* So if you want to measure a height of a cliff or anything like that, just throw (freely) anything having a little dense mass (upto 200ft mass of the objects doesn't matter as no matter how much heavy it is, everything falls at the same rate if falling freely).
* Start the timer when you leave the object and stop it when the objects hits the ground or the surface.
* And the app gives you predicted height!
* The app works almost perfect for heights between 10 to 200ft.
